# Repos that WILL be synced (not on skip list)

**On the new Mac:** This is the list of **14 repos to clone** from GitHub. Create `~/Repositories`, then clone each (e.g. `git clone git@github.com:thedoctorJJ/REPO_NAME.git`). See **GITHUB-SETUP-NEW-MAC.md** first for Git + SSH setup.

**On the old Mac:** These folders were backed up / processed by `backup-before-migration.sh`. If you want to skip any of the 14 on the new Mac, simply don't clone that repo.
